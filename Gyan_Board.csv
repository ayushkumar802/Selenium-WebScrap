0,Chapter 1 - Matter in Our Surroundings,States of matter,"Matter around us exists in their different states – Solid, liquid, and Gas. The Solid state. Solid have a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Solid can not be compressed. Solids have high density. Force of attraction between the particles is very sstrong. The space between the particles of solids is negligible. The liquid state Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape. liquids can be compressed. liquids have less density than solids. intermolecular forces attraction are weaker than solids. the liquids have greater space between the particles than solids. The gaseous state Gaseous have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. Gaseous can be compressed easily. Gaseous have the least density among solids and liquids. intermolecular forces of attraction are the weakest. The space between the particles is the largest."
1,Chapter 1 - Matter in Our Surroundings,Can matter change its state?,"Effect of change of temperature:- On increasing the temperature of solids, the kinetic energy of the particles increases in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely. A stage is reached when the solids melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The process of melting, that is change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. The melting point of ice is 273.15K or 0 o C. Latent Heat-The hidden heat which breaks the force of attraction between the molecules is known as the latent heat. Since the heat energy is hidden in the bulk of the matter is called latent heat. The temperature at which a liquid start boiling at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon particles from the bulk of the liquid gain energy to change into the gaseous state. for ex- boiling point of water is 100 o C.{or 100oC=273+100=373K} Latent heat of vaporisation : The heat energy required to convert 1 kilogram of liquid into gas, at atmospheric pressure, at its boiling point is known as the latent heat of vaporisation. There are some that change directly from solid state to gaseous state and vice versa without changing into liquid state. Sublimation: A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called Sublimation. Deposition: The direct change of gas to solid without changing into liquid is called Deposition. Effect of change of pressure Solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice because solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere."
2,Chapter 1 - Matter in Our Surroundings,Physical nature of matter and Characteristics of particles of matter,"Anything that occupies space and has mass and is felt by senses is called matter. Matter is the form of five basic elements that is called punch tantra -Air,Earth,Fire,Sky and Water. Characterstics of particles of matter 1.Made of tiny particles. 2.Vacant spaces exist in particles. 3.Particles are in continuous motion. 4. Particles are held together by forces of attraction. 5.Particles of matter have space between them. 6.As the temperature rises , particles move faster. So, we can say that with increase in temperature the kinetic energy of the particles also increase. 7.particles of matter attract each other. The strength of this force of attraction varies from one matter to another Diffusion: The intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion."
3,Chapter 1 - Matter in Our Surroundings,Evaporation,"Evaporation: Change of a liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called Evaporation. Factors affecting evaporation: An increase of surface area: If the surface phenomenon. If the surface area is increased, the rate of evaporation increases. for Ex- While putting clothes for drying up we spread them out. An increase of temperature: With the increase of temperaturte, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state. A decrease in huminity: Huminity is the amount of water vapour present in the air. The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in the air is already high the rate of evaporation decreases. An increase in wind speed: Clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in wind speed, the particles of water vapour move away with the wind. Condensation: The process in which a gas on cooling turns into a liquid at a specific temperature is called Condensation. Vaporisation: The process in which a liquid on heating changes into gas is called Vaporisation. Solidification: The process in which a liquid on cooling changes into solid is called Solidification. Fusion: The process in which a solid on heating changes into liquid then it is called Fusion. PLASMA: The state consists of super energetic and super excited particles. These particles are in the form of ionised gases . The fluorescent tube and neon sign bulbs consists of plasma. BOSE EINSTEIN CONDENSATE: Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose made a study regarding the fifth state of matter. Based on his study, Albert Einstein predicted a fifth state of matter called the Bose- Einstein Condensate. The Bose- Einstein Condensate or BEC is formed by coling a gas of extremely low density to super low temperatures.

4,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Introduction of Is Matter Around Us Pure,"Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. Matter can be divided into two categories. Pure substance: It consists of single types of particles which are the same in their chemical nature. Mixtures: Mixtures consist of two or more particles. MIXTURES AND IT’S TYPES Mixtures consist of more than one kind of pure substance which can be separated by physical method. Mixtures are of two types: Homogeneous Mixtures: A mixture is solid to be homogeneous if all the components of the mixture are uniformly mixed and there are no boundaries of separation between them. Ex- Sugar in water, etc. Heterogeneous Mixtures: A mixture is solid to be heterogeneous if all the components of the mixture are not uniformly separated between them. Ex-Water and Sand, etc."
5,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Solution And It’s Properties,"A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Ex- Lemonade and soda water. ALLOYS:- Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals or metal or non-metal and cannot be separated into their components by physical method. Ex- Brass is a mixture of 30% Zinc and 70% Copper. Types of Solution: Solvent: The component of the solution that dissolves the other components in it is called solvent. it is in a larger amount. Solute: The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent is called solute. it is in lesser amount. EX: A solution of sugar in water is a solid in liquid solution. In this solution, the sugar is solute and water is solvent. PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIOON It is a homogeneous mixture. Particles of solutions are small so they cannot be seen with naked eyes. They do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution. So, the path of light is not visible in a solution. the solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by filteration and decantation."
6,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Concentration,"Saturated solution: At any particular temperature, are solution that has dissolved as much as it is capable of dissolving, it is said to be a saturated solution Unsaturated solution: If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation label, it is called an unsaturated solution. Solubility: The amount of solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. The concentration of solution is the amount of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solution, or the amount of solute dissolved in a given mass or volume of solvent. Concentration of solution = Amount of solute Amount of solution Two methods to find the mass or volume percentage of a solution. Mass by mass percentage of solution = mass of solute mass of solution ∗ 100 Mass by volume percentage of solution = mass of solute mass of solution ∗ 100"
7,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Suspension,A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Properties of Suspension: It is a heterogeneous mixture. Particles can be seen by the naked eye. The particles scatter a beam of light passing through it. and make its path visible. The solute particles settle down when left undisturbed and then the particles can be separated by the filtration process.
8,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Colloidal,"Colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture in which the size of particles lies between the true solution and the suspension. Ex-Milk. Properties of colloid: It is a heterogeneous mixture. Particles of colloid is too small to be individually seen by the naked eye. Colloid scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. They do not settle down when left undisturbed that colloid is quite stable. It cannot be separated by filtration but can be separated by the process of Centrifugation. Colloid solution scatter of a beam of light that is called Tyndall effect. The component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium. Separating the components of a mixture. Different methods of separations are used to get individual component from a mixture . With the help of separation we can study the individual components of the mixture. Methods of separation of the components of mixture. Evaporation Centrifugation Sublimation Chromatography Distillation Crystallization We can separate the volatile component(solvent) from its non-volatile solute by the method of evaporation. The principle is that the denser particles are forced to the bottom and the lighter particles stay at the top when spun rapidly this is called centrifugation. APPLICATIONS Used in diagnostic laboratories for blood and urine tests. Uses in dairies and home to separate butter from cream. Used in washing machines to squeeze out water from wet clothes. Separating two immiscible liquids The separation of separating two immiscible liquids is carried out by the use of funnel. And also the basic principle involve is the difference between the densities of two liquids from two separate layers. Application of funnel: To separate mixture of oil and water. In the extraction of iron from its ore, the lighter slag is removed from the top by this method to leave the molten iron at the bottom in the furnace. Sublimation: To separate such mixtures that contain a sublimable volatile component from a non sublimable impurity, this is called sublimation process. Ex-Ammonium Chloride, Camphor, Naphthalene and Anthracene. Chromatography: Used to separate those solutes which dissolve in the same solvent. It is used for separation of colors. The colors which are more soluble in water rises faster and get colors get separated into layers. Application : To separate colors in a dye. To separate pigments from natural colors. To separate drugs from blood. Distillation: It is used for separation of components of a mixture containing to miscible liquids that boil without decomposition and have sufficient difference in their boiling points. Ex- Mixture of acetone and water is separated by this method. Fractional distillation : It is used to separate a mixture of two or more miscible liquids for which the difference in boiling points is less than 25K. Ex- Air can be separated by this method. Crystallization: It is used to remove impurities from solid and purify it and also it separates of pure solid from mixture in the form of crystals. Ex- Salt from sea water. Application: Purification of salt that we get from sea water. Separation of crystals of Alum (Phitkiri). from impure samples."
9,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Physical And Chemical Change,"Physical change: The properties that can be observed and specified like color, hardness, rigidity, fluidity, density, melting point, boiling point etc. are the physical change. Chemical change: During this process one substance reacts with another to undergo a change in chemical composition. Chemical properties brings change in the chemical properties of matter and we get new substances. Difference between physical change and chemical change:- Physical Change Chemical Change No new substance is formed during the change. Atleast one or more new substance is formed. Change is temporary. Change is permanent. Reversible process. Irreversible process. Usually no change or small change in energy. Energy change is observed. Only physical properties of substance changes i.e size, shape and appearance. In chemical properties of newly formed substance will be different."
10,Chapter 2- Is matter around us pure,Types Of Pure Substances,"On the basis of their chemical composition substances can be classified either as elements or compound. Elements: An element is a basic form of matter that can not be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reaction. It is divided into metals, non-metals and metalloids. Properties of metals They have a lusture. They have silvery-grey or golden- yellow color. They conduct heat and electricity. They are ductile. They are malleable. They are sonorous. Ex- Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Sodium, Potassium etc. Mercury is the only metal that is found liquid at room temperature. Properties of non-metal They display a variety of colors. They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. They are not lustrous, sonorous, or malleable. Ex- hydrogen, oxygen, iodine, Carbon(coal and coke) ,Bromine and Chlorine etc. Metalloids Some elements have intermediate properties between those of metals and non-metals, they are called metalloids. Ex- Boron, Silicon and Germanium etc. Some characteristics of elements: Majority of the elements are solid. Eleven elements are in a gaseous state at room temperature. Two elements are liquid at room temperature that is Mercury and Bromine. Elements like Gallium and Cesium become liquid at temperature slightly above room temperature(303K). Compound A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements, chemically combined with one another in a fixed proportion. Difference between mixture and Compound:- Mixture Compounds Elements or compounds just mix together to form a mixture and no new compound is formed. Elements react to form new compounds. A mixture has a variable composition. The composition of each new substance is always fixed. A mixture shows the properties of the constituent substances. The new substance has totally different properties. The constituents can be separated fairly easily by physical methods. The constituents can be separated only by chemical or electrochemical reactions."
11,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Introduction of Atoms and Molecules,"Around 500BC. An Indian philosopher Maharishi Kanad, postulated that if he go on dividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller and smaller particles. Ultimately, a time will come when we shall come across the smallest particles beyond which further division will not be possible which is known as “Parmanu”. Ancient Greek philosophers-Democritus and Leucippus called these indivisible particles Atoms. Antoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation of chemical sciences by establishing two important laws of chemical combination. Laws of chemical combination This law established after much experimentations by Lavoisier and Joseph L. Proust. law of conservation of mass: law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither ne created nor be destroyed in a chemical reaction. Ex-A (reactant) + B(reactant)=AB ( Product) mass of A + mass of B=mass of AB Law of constant proportion: In a chemical reaction, compounds always contain the same elements present in definite proportion by mass irrespective of their source. Ex-> 1. ) 18gm of H 2 O = 2gm of Hydrogen + 1gm of Oxygen mass of hydrogen mass of oxygen = 2 16 = 1 8 2. ) 36gm of H 2 O = 4gm of Hydrogen + 32gm of Oxygen mass of hydrogen mass of oxygen = 4 32 = 1 8 This verifies law of constant proportions as the ratio of mass of hydrogen to oxygen is always same."
12,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Dalton’s Atomic theory,"According to Dalton’s Atomic theory, all matter, whether an element, a compound or a mixture is composed of small particles called atoms. Six postulates of Dalton’s Atomic theory: All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are indivisible particles, which cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and chemical properties Atoms of different elements have different masses and chemical properties. Atoms combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to form compounds. The relative number and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound. Atoms: Atoms are building blocks of all matter. According to modern Atomic theory, an element is the smallest particle of an element which takes part in chemical reaction. Atoms are very small and which can’t be seen even through very powerful microscope. Atomic radius is measured in nanometres. 1nm=10-9m Modern day symbols of Atoms of different elements. Dalton was the first scientist to use the symbols for elements in a very specific sense. Berzilius suggested that the symbols of elements be made from one or two letters of the name of the element."
13,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Atomic mass,"Dalton’s Atomic theory proposed the idea of atomic mass which explained the law of constant proportion so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom. The mass of an atom of an element is called its atomic mass. In 1961, IUPAC have accepted atomic mass unit (u) to express atomic and molecular mass of elements and compounds. The atomic mass unit is defined as the quantity of mass = 1/12 of mass of an atom carbon-12. 1 amu or u =1/12 mass of an atom of carbon-12 1u = 1.66  10-27kg Element Atomic mass(u) Hydrogen 1 Carbon 12 Nitrogen 14 Oxygen 16 Sodium 23 Magnesium 24 Sulphur 32 Chlorine 35.5 Calcium 40 Atomic existence Most of the atoms of elements are not able to exist independently. Atoms from molecules and ions and these molecules or ions aggregate in large numbers to form matter."
14,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Molecule,"A molecule is in general a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. A molecule can be defined as the smallest particle of an element or a compound that is capable of an independent existence and show all the properties of that substance. Atoms of the same elements join together to form molecules then it is called homo molecules. Ex-H2, and O2. Atoms of the different elements join together to form molecules then it is called hetero molecules. Ex- H2O, SO2 Monoatomic: When molecule consisting of only one atom then it is called monoatomic. Ex- Argon(Ar) , Helium(He) Diatomic: A molecule which contains two atoms then it is called diatomic. Ex- H2, O2. Triatomic: A molecule which contain three atoms then it is called triatomic. Ex- Phosphorus (P3) Polyatomic: A molecule which contain four atoms then it is called polyatomic. Ex- Sulphur(S4)"
15,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Ions,"Compounds composed of metals and non-metals contain charged species. The charged species are known as ions. A negatively charged ion is called an “anion” and a positively charged ion is called a ” cation”. Ex-NaCl where Na+ and Cl– Ions may consist of a single charged atom or a group of atoms that have a net charge on them. Polyatomic ion: A group of atoms carrying a charge is known as a polyatomic ion. Chemical Formula: The chemical formula of a compound is a symbolic representation of its composition. Characteristics of chemical formulae: The valencies or charges on the ion must balance. When a compound is formed of metal and non-metal, symbol of metal comes first. Ex- CaO, NaCl, CuO. When polyatomic ions are used, the ions are enclosed in brackets before writing the number to show the ratio. Ex- Ca(OH)2, (NH4)2SO4 Rules for writing chemical formulae We first write symbol of element which form compound. Below the symbol of each element, we should write their valency. Now cross over the valencies of combining atoms. With first atom, we write the valency of second atom ( as a subscript) With second atom, we write the valency of first atom( Subscript)."
16,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Molecular Mass,"The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of the substance. Ex- Atomic mass of H2O = 2Atomic mass of Hydrogen + 1Atomic mass of Oxygen = 21 + 116 = 2 + 16 = 18 u Formula Unit Mass The formula unit mass of a substance is a sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula unit of a compound. It is calculated in the same manner of molecules mass. Ex- Calculate the formula unit mass of CaCl2. = Atomic mass of Ca + 2Atomic mass of Chlorine = 40 + 235.5 = 40 + 71 = 111u Ions: An ion may be defined as an atom or group of atoms having positive or negative charge. Some positively charged ions : Na+, K+, Ca2+, Al3+ Some negatively charged ions. Cl– ( Chlorine ion), S2-( Sulphide ion) We can classify ions in two types: Simple ions Mg2+( Magnesium ion) Na+ ( Sodium ion) Cl– ( Chloride ion) Al3+ ( Aluminium ion) Compound ions NH4- (Ammonium ion) CO32-(Carbonate ion) SO42-(Sulphate ion) OH– ( Hydroxide ion) Chemical formulae of ionic compounds(polyatomic)"
17,Chapter 3-Atoms and Molecules,Mole Concept,"A group of 6.0221023 particles ( atoms, molecules or ions) of a substance is called a mole of that substance. 1 mole of atoms = 6.0221023atoms 1 mole of molecules = 6.0221023molecules Ex-1 mole of oxygen = 6.0221023 oxygen atoms. NOTE: 6.0221023 is Avogadro number (L). 1 mole of atoms of an element has a mass equal to gram atomic mass of the element. MOLAR MASS : The molar mass of a substance is the mass of 1 mole of that substance. It is equal to the 6.0221023 atoms of that element/ substance. EXAMPLE: Atomic mass of hydrogen(H) is 1u. Its molar mass 1g/mol. Atomic mass of Nitrogen(N) is 14u. So, its molar mass of nitrogen is 14g/mol. Molar mas of S8 = mass of S8 = 328 = 256g/mol. Molar mass of HCl = mass of H + mass of Cl = 1+ 35.5=36.5g/mol. IMPORTANT FORMULAE Number of moles(n)= given mass/molar mass=m/M Number of moles(n)= Given number of particles/Avogadro’s number m/M = N/N0 m=MN/N0 Percentage of any atom in given compound = Mass of element/mass of compound100 Example: Calculate the number of moles for the following:- (1) 52g of He ( Finding mole from mass ) (2) 12.0441023 number of He atoms (finding mole from number of particles). Sol:- No. of moles = n Given mass = m Molar mass = M Given number of particles = N Avogadro’s number of particles = N0 Atomic mass of He = 4u molar mass of He = 4g The number of moles = Given mass/Molar mass n = 52/4 = 13 1 mole = 6.0221023 number of moles = Given number of particles/ Avogadro number n = N/N0 = 12.0441023/6.0221023 = 2"
18,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Discovery of Electrons-Cathode rays(J.J Thomson),"Many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was not a simple, indivisible particle but contained at least one sub-atomic particle – The electron identified by J.J Thomson. Even before the electron was identified , E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations in a gas discharge and called them canal rays. These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another sub-atomic particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron. Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron. It was given the name of proton. In general, an electron is represented as ‘ e– ‘ and a proton as ‘ p+ ‘. The mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to negligible and its charge is minus one. It seemed highly likely that an atom was composed protons and electrons, mutually balancing their charges. It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom, for whereas electrons could easily be peeled off but not protons."
19,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Rutherford’s Model Of An Atom,"Ernest Rutherford designed an experiment, fast moving alpha (α) particles were made to fall on a thin gold foil. he selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick. α-particles are doubly- charged helium ions. Since they have a mass of 4u, the fast-moving α-particles have a considerable amount of enegy. It was expected that α-particles would be deflected by the sub-atomic particles in the gold atoms. Since the α-particles were much heavier than the protons, he did not expect to see large deflections. But, the α-particles scattering experiment gave totally unexpected results, the following observations were made: Most of the fast moving α-particles passed straight through the gold foil. Some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small angles. Surprisingly one out of every 12000 particles appeared to rebound. In the words of Rutherford ” This result was almost as incredible as if you fire a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue and it comes back and hits you”. Activity: Let a child stand in front of a wall with his eyes closed. let him throw stones at the wall from a distance. He will hear a sound when each stone striking the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a blind – folded child were to throw stones at a barbed – wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them. Rutherford concluded from the α- particles scattering experiment that:- Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected. Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occuoies bery little nspace. A very small fraction of α- particles were deflected by1800, indicating that all positive charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom. He calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom. Which had the following features: There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus. The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths. the size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom. Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of the atom The revolution of the electron in in a circular orbit is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration. During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know that atoms are quite stable."
20,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Bohr’s Model of Atom,"In order to overcome the objections raised against Rutherford’s model of the atom, Neils Bohr put forward the following postulates about the model of an atom: Only certain special orbits known as discrete orbits of electrons, are allowed inside the atom. While revolving in discrete orbits the electrons do not radiate energy. These orbits or shells are called energy levels. Energy levels in an atom are shown in image- These orbits or shells are represented by the letters K,L,M,N….. or the numbers n= 1,2,3,4…."
21,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Neutrons,"In 1932, J. Chadwick discovered another sub-atomic particle which had no charge and a mass nearly equal to that of a proton. It was eventually named as neutron. Neutrons are present in the nucleus of all atoms, except hydrogen. In general, a neutron is represented as ‘n’. The mass of an atom is therefore given by the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus. particles Explorer mass charge Electron J.J Thomson(1897) 9.110-31kg -Ve Proton Rutherford(1917) 1.672510-27kg +Ve Neutron Chadwick(1932) 1.674810-27kg No charge How are Electrons Distributed in Different Orbits (Shells)? The distribution of electrons into different orbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr and Bury. The following rules are followed for writing the number of electrons in different energy levels or shells: The maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by the formula 2n2, where ‘n’ is the orbit number or energy level index, 1,2,3,…. Hence the maximum number of electrons in different shells are as follows: – First orbit or K-shell will be = 2×12= 2, Second orbit or L-shell will be = 2×22=8 Third shell or M-shell will be = 2×32 = 18, Fourth orbit or N-shell will be = 2×42 = 32, and so on. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in a given shell, unless the inner shells are filled. That is, the shells are filed in a step-wise manner. Atomic structure of the first eighteen elements is shown in image- fig: Schematic atomic structure of the first eighteenth elements"
22,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,The structure of an atom,"The discovery of two fundamental particles (electrons and protons) inside the atom, led to the failure of this aspect Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom. For example this, many scientists proposed various atomic models. J.J Thomson was the first one to propose a model for the structure of an atom. Thomson’s Model Of An Atom Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. A watermelon, the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon, while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere, like the seeds in the watermelon. Thomson proposed that: An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it. The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. Conclusion: Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms are electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model."
23,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Atomic Number and Mass Number,"ATOMIC NUMBER: Protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number of protons of an atom. which determines its atomic number. It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms of an element have the same atomic number, Z. In fact, elements are defined by the number of protons they posses. For hydrogen, Z=1, because in hydrogen atom, only one proton is present in the nucleus. Similarly, for carbon, Z=6. Therefore, the atomic number is defined as the total number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom. MASS NUMBER: After studying the properties of the sub- atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude that mass of an atom is practically dur to protons and neutrons alone. These are present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence protons and neutrons are also called nucleus. Therefore, the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. For ex – Mass of carbon 12u because it has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, 6u + 6+ = 12u. Similarly , the mass of aluminium is 27u ( 13 protons + 14 neutrons ). The mass number is defined as the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. In the notation fort an atom, the atomic number, mass number and symbol of the element are to be written as"
24,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Valency,"The electrons in an atom are arranged in different shells/orbits. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as the valence electrons. From the Bohr-Bury scheme, we also know that the outermost shell of an atom can accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It was observed that the atoms of elements, having a completely filled outermost shell show little chemical activity. in other words, their combining capacity or valency is zero. Of these inert6 elements, the helium atom has two electrons in its outermost shell and all other elements have atoms with eight electrons in the outermost shell. The combining capacity capacity of the atoms of other elements, that is, their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements, was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fully- filled outermost shell. An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons electrons was said to posses an octet. Atoms would thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell. This was done by sharing, gaining or losing electrons. the number of electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell, gives us directly the combining capacity of the element. Ex- Hydrogen/ Lithium/ Sodium atoms contain one electron each in their outermost shell, therefore each one of them can lose one electron. So, they are said to have valency of one. The valency of magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has three electrons in its outermost shell. if the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is close to its full capacity, then valency is determined in a different way. Ex- Fluorine atom has 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its valency could be 7 but it is easier for fluorine to gain one electron instead of losing seven electron. Hence, its valency is determined by subtracting seven electrons from the octet and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine. Therefore, an atom of each element has a definite combining capacity, called valency.

25,Chapter 4 - Structure of the Atom,Isotopes and Isobars,"Isotopes are defined as the atoms of the same element, which have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, take the case of hydrogen atom, it has three atomic species, namely protium ( 11H ), deuterium ( 1 2H or D) and tritium (11H or T ).The atomic number of each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2 and 3, respective. Other such examples are (1) Carbon 612C and 614C, (2) Chlorine, 1735Cl and 1737Cl, etc. Many elements consist of a mixture of isotopes. Each isotopes of an element is a pure substance. The chemical properties of isotopes are similar but their physical properties are different. Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic forms, with masses 35u and 37u in the ratio of 3:1. The mass of an atom of any natural element is taken as the average mass of all the naturally occuring atoms of that element. If an atom has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom would be the same as the sum of protons and neutrons in it, then we have to know the percentage of each isotopic form and then the average mass is calculated. (3575/100 +3725/100) = 105/4 + 37/4 = 142/4 = 35.5u So, it will contain both isotopes of chlorine and the average mass is 35.5u. APPLICATION: Chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are the same, some of them are as follows:- An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel in nuclear reactions. An isotope of cobalt is used in the treatment of cancer. An isotope of iodine is used in the treatment of goitre. Isobars The number of electrons in these atoms is different, but the mass number of both these elements is 40. That is, the total number of nucleus is the same in the atoms of this pair of elements. Atoms of different atomic numbers, which have the same mass number, are known as isobars."
26,Chapter 5 - The Fundamental Unit of Life,Introduction of The Fundamental Unit of Life,"Cell is the structural and functional unit of life. It is the basic unit of life. Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive microscope. Leeuwenhoek (1674), with the improved microscope, discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time. It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell. Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘ protoplasm ‘ for the fluid substance of the cell."
27,Chapter 5 - The Fundamental Unit of Life,Cell Theory,"The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was presented by two biologists, schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839). The cell theory was further expanded by Virchow (1855) by suggesting that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and its various organelles. Types of organisms There are two types of cells: Unicellular Multicellular Unicellular-Those organisms which are composed of single cell are known as unicellular organisms, which perform all the function. Ex-Amoeba, Paramecium, Chlamydomonas and bacteria. Multicellular- Those organisms which are composed of many cells which are known as multicellular, which perform all the different functions in it to form various body parts. Ex- fungi, plants and animals. The shape and size of cells are related to the specific function they perform. Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; Ex- nerve cells have a typical shape. Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristics of all living forms. There is a division of labour in multicellular organisms such as human beings. This means that different parts of the human body perform different functions. The human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. Each cell has got certain specific components within it known as cell organelles. Each kind of cell organelle performs a specific function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material from the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and perform all its functions because of these organelles. These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the cell."
28,Chapter 5 - The Fundamental Unit of Life,What is a Cell Made Up of? What is the Structural Organisation of a Cell?,"Cell has special components called organelles. Cell under a microscope, we would come across three features in almost every cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL MEMBRANE This is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. The plasma membrane allows permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane. Diffusion: Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion. Substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell. As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside the cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by the process of diffusion when level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the xell and its external environment. Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. Osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high concentration through a semi- permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration. There are three following things could happen when we put an animal cell or plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt:- If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration that the cell, meaning that th4e outside solution is very dilute, such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell that will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. If the medium has exactly the same water concentrate as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins. However, we can observe the structure of the plasma membrane through an electron microscope. The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes."
29,Chapter 5 - The Fundamental Unit of Life,Cell Wall,"Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis. It appears that only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without brusting."
30,Chapter 5 - The Fundamental Unit of Life,Nucleus,"The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm. The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of features from parents to next to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Prokaryotes:- Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (pro= primitive or primary; karyote = karyon = nucleus). Eukaryotes:- Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells:- Prokaryotes Eukaryotes Cells of organism lacks nuclear membrane. Cells of organism have nuclear membrane. Single chromosomes. Single or multi chromosomes. Reproduction is always asexual. Reproduction is both sexual and asexual. Always unicellular. Often multicellular. Membrane bound cell organelles absent. Membrane bound organelles are present like mitochondria Cell division is by binary fission. Cell division is by mitosis or meiosis. Centriole is absent. Centriole is present only in animals. Size: generally small ( 1 -10 μm) 1 μm=10-6m Size : generally large (5=100 μm) Ex-Bacteria, Blue green algae, etc. Ex- Fungi, plant cell, Animal cell etc. Fig:- It shows the difference between the prokaryotic cell and Eukaryotic cell."
31,Chapter 5 - The Fundamental Unit of Life,Cell Organelles,"A cell has to perform different functions with the help of its various membrane-bound organelles. It has to synthesize substances, e.g., protein synthesis by ribosomes, lipid synthesis on the surface of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), photosynthesis of food (e.g., glucose, starch) by6 chloroplasts. It has to secrete cell products, e.g., enzymes, hormones, mucus, etc. it has to digest those substance which are taken up by the cell during endocytosis. Such intracellular digestion is done by enzymes of lysosomes. It has to generate energy, e.g., synthesis of energy- rich ATP (adenosine triphosphate) by mitochondria. Every cell has a membrane around it to keep its own contents separate from the external environment. Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function. To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other, these cells use membrane-bound little structures (or ‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some of these organelles are visible only with an electron microscope. Some important examples of cell organelles are as follows:- Endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria, plastids and vacuoles. ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM:- The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane- bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER- rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER(Rough endoplasmic reticulum):- It looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on nee, using the ER. SER(Smooth endoplasmic reticulum):- The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane biogenesis. Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, it always forms a network system. Thus, one function of the ER is to serve as channels for the transport of materials (especially proteins) between various regions of the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The ER also functions as a cytoplasmic framework providing a surface for some of the biological activities of the cell. In the liver cells of the group of animals called vertebrates. SER plays a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons and drugs. GOLGI APPARATUS The Golgi apparatus, first described by Camillo Golgi, consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system. The material synthesized near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. Its function include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also involved cin the formation of lysosomes. LYSOSOMES Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of the cell. Lysosomes help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles. Foreign material entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break them up into small pieces. Lysosomes are able to do this because they contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material. During the disturbance in cellular metabolism, fir example, when the cell gets damaged, lysosomes may burst and the enzymes digest their own cell. Therefore, lysosomes are known as the ‘suicidal bags’ of a cell. Structurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes. These enzymes are made by RER. MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings instead of just one. The outer membrane is very porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds create a large surface area for ATP-generating chemical reactions. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that have their own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins. PLASTIDS Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids-chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucuplasts (white or colourless plastids). Plastids containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll. leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granuels are stored. The internal organisation of the plastids consists of numerous membrane layers embedded in a material called the stroma. Plastids are similar to mitochondria in external structure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes. VACUOLES Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while olant cells have very large vacuoles. The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume. In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell. Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These include amino acid, sugars, various organic acids and some proteins. In single-celled organisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed. In some unicellular organisms, specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling excess water and some wastes from the cell. Each cell thus acquires its structure and ability to function because of the organisation of its membrane and organelles in specific ways. The cell thus has a basic structural organisation. This helps the cells to perform functions like respiration, obtaining nutrition, and clearing of waste material, or forming new proteins. Thus, the cell is the fundamental structural unit of living organisms. It is also the basic functional unit of life."
32,Chapter 6 - Tissues,Animal Tissues,"Breathing is one of the most vital activity for humans. When we breathe, we can, in fact, feel the movement of our lungs and diaphragm. For breathing, we have specialized cells in our bodies, called muscle cells. The contraction and relaxation of these muscle cells result in movement. During breathing we inhale oxygen and it goes to our two lungs and then it transported to all cells of our body through the blood. Mitochondria present in each and every cell of our body, utilises oxygen to generate energy in the form of ATP molecules. These ATP molecules provide energy for all sorts of activities performed by our body cells. Blood is a fluid connective tissue. It flows and connect different parts of body. It carries oxygen and food to all cells and in return collects metabolic wastes (e.g., carbon dioxide) from them. Blood and muscles are both examples of tissues found in our body. On the basis of the functions they perform in the body of multicellular animals, the animal tissues are classified as 1. Epithelial tissue 2. Muscle or muscular tissue 3. Connective tissue 4. Nervous tissue. Epithelial Tissue:-Epithelial tissue is the simplest tissue. It is a protective tissue of the animal body. The cells of this tissue are tightly packed and they form a continuous sheet. Cells of epithelial contain very little or no intercellular matrix. The tissues covers most organs and cavities within the body. It also forms barrier to keep different body systems separate. The skin and lining of buccal cavity, blood vessels, alveoli and kidneys tubules are made of epithelial tissue. Epithelial cells lie on a delicate non-cellular basement membrane which contains a special form of matrix protein, called collagen. Functions of Epithelial tissue:- The cells of the body surface form the outer layer skin. These protect the underlying cells from drying, injury, and chemical effects. They also protect the body from viral or bacterial infection. Inside the body, epithelial cells form lining of mouth and alimentary canal and protect these organs. Epithelial tissues help in absorption of water and nutrients. Epithelial tissues help in elimination of waste products. Some epithelial tissues perform secretory function. They secrete a variety of substances such as sweat, saliva, enzymes, etc. There are four types of epithelial tissue:- Squamous epithelial Cuboidal epithelial Columnar epithelial Glandular epithelial Ciliated epithelial Squamous epithelial:- Squamous epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and the lining of the mouth are also covered with squamous epithelium. The skin, which protects the body, is also made of squamous epithelium. Cuboidal epithelial:- It consists of cube-like cells which are square in section but the free surface appear hexagonal. It is found in kidney tubules, thyroid vesicles and in glands (e.g., salivary glands, sweat glands and exocrine pancreas). It forms germinal epithelium of gonads (tastes and ovaries). It helps in absorption, excretion and secretion. It also provides mechanical support. Columnar epithelial:- The columnar epithelial consists of cells which are taller than broader (i.e., pillar-like). The nuclei are towards the base and sometimes the free ends of cells have a brush border containing microvilli. It forms the lining of stomach, small intestine and colon, forming mucous membrane. It also forms lining of gall bladder and oviducts and facilitates movement across the cells. Its main functions include absorption (e.g., stomach, intestine ) and secretion (e.g., mucus by goblet cells or mucus membrane). Glandular epithelial:- The columnar epithelial is often modified to form glands which secrete chemicals. Ciliated epithelial:-Ciliated cuboidal epithelial is found in the sperm ducts. The ciliated columnar epithelium lines the trachea (wind-pipe), bronchi (lungs), kidney tubules and oviducts (Fallopian tubes). The rhythmic, concerted beating of the cilia moves solid particles (e.g., mucus) in one direction through the ducts."
33,Chapter 6 - Tissues,Connective Tissue,"The connective tissue is specialised to connect and anchor various body organs, muscles to bones, blind tissues and can also give support to various parts of body by creating a packing around organs. The packing would prevent the organs from getting displaced by body movements. Thus, the main functions of connective tissue are binding, supporting, and packing together different organs of the body. The cells of connective tissue are living, separated from each other (i.e., loosely spaced ) and low in number. Homogeneous, gel-like intercellular substance called medium or matrix forms the main bulk of the connective tissue. Thus, space between cells is filled with a non-living matrix which may be solid as in bone and cartilage and fluid as in the blood. The matrix may be jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature of matrix differs in concordance with the function of the particular connective tissue. Blood:- Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called plasma, in which red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets are suspended. The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones .Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hormones and waste materials to different parts of the body. Blood transports nutrients, hormones and vitamins to the tissue and transports excretory products from the tissue to the liver and kidney. The red blood corpuscles (RBCs) carry oxygen to the tissues for the oxidation of food stuff. The white blood cells (WBCs) fight disease either by engulfing and destroying foreign bodies or by producing antitoxins and antibodies that neutralise the harmful effects of germs. Blood platelets disintegrated at the site of injury and help in the clotting of blood. Bone:- Bone is another example of connective tissue. It forms the framework that supports the body. It also anchors the muscles and supports the main organs of the body. it is a strong and nonflexible tissue . It is porous, highly vascular, mineralised, hard and rigid. Its matrix is made up of proteins. Bone cells are embedded in a hard matrix that is composed of calcium and phosphorus compounds. Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligaments. This tissue is very elastic. It has considerable strength. Ligaments contain very little matrix. Tendons connect muscles to bones and are another type of connective tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great strength but limited flexibility. Cartilage:- The cartilage is a specialised connective which is compact and less vascular. It has widely spaced out cells. Its extensive matrix is composed of proteins, and is slightly hardened by calcium salts. Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints and is also present in the nose, ear, trachea and larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the ears, but we can not bend the bones in our arms. Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles, around blood vessels and verves and in the bone marrow. It fills the space inside the organs, supports internal organs and helps in repair of tissues. fat storing adipose tissue is found below the skin and between internal organs, The cells of this skin tissue are filled with fat globules. Storage of fats also lets it act as an insulator."
34,Chapter 6 - Tissues,Muscular Tissue,"Muscular tissue consists of elongated cells, also called muscle fibres. This tissue is responsible for movement in our body. Muscles contain special proteins called contractile proteins, which contract and relax to cause movement. Muscles present in our limbs move when we want them to, and stop when we so decide. Such muscles are called voluntary muscles. These muscles are also called skeletal muscles as they are mostly attached to bones and help in body movement. On the basis of their location, structure and function, there are following three types of muscle fibres :- 1. Striated muscles 2. Smooth muscle 3. Cardiac muscles Striated Muscles:- These muscles show alternate light and dark bands or striations when stained appropriately. They are called striated muscles. The cells of this tissue are long, cylindrical, unbranched and multinucleate. They are attached to the bones and are responsible for body movements, they are called skeletal muscles. These muscles work accordingly to our will, they are also called voluntary muscles. Smooth Muscles:- Smooth muscles do not work according to our will, so they are also called involuntary muscles. In some organs, smooth muscles contract throughout the organ to produce extrusive movements as in the urinary bladder, the gall bladder and the uterus. They are also found in iris of the eye, in the bronchi of the lungs. Cardiac Muscles:- The muscles of the heart show rhythmic contraction and relaxation throughout life. These involuntary muscles are called cardiac muscles. Heart muscle cells are cylindrical, branched and uninucleate. The contraction and relaxation of the heart muscles help to pump and distribute blood to various parts of body."
35,Chapter 6 - Tissues,Nervous Tissue,"Nervous tissue is a tissue which is specialized to transmit messages within our body. Brain, spinal cord and nerves are all composed of nervous tissue. Nervous tissue contains highly specialized unit cells called nerve cells or neurons. Neurons have the ability to receive stimuli from within or outside the body and to conduct impulses to different parts of our body. The impulse travels from one neuron to another neuron. A neuron consists of a cell body with a nucleus and cytoplasm, from which long thin hair-like parts arise . Usually each neuron has a single long part, called the axon, and many short, branched parts called dendrites. An individual nerve cell may be up to a metre long. many nerve fibres bound together by connective tissue make up nerve. The functional combination of nerve and muscle tissue is fundamental to most animals. This combination enables animals to move rapidly in response to stimuli."
36,Chapter 7 - Diversity in Living Organisms,The Hierarchy of Classification-Groups,"Biologists, such as Ernst Haeckel (1894), Robert Whittaker (1959) and Carl Woese (1977) have tried to classify all living organisms into broad categories, called Kingdoms. The classification Whittaker proposed has five kingdoms : Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia, and is widely used. These groups are formed on the basis of their cell structure, mode and source of nutrition and body organisation. The modification Woese introduced by dividing the Monera into Archaebacteria (or Archaea) and Eubacteria (or Bacteria) is also in use. Further classification is done by naming the sub-groups at various levels as given in the following scheme: Kingdom Phylum (for animals) / Division (for plants) Class Order Family Genus Species Species: It is a basic unit for understanding taxonomy as well as evolution. Species is a group of individuals with similar morphological characters, which are able to breed among themselves and produce fertile offsprings of their own kind. Individually of the same species resemble each other closely both structurally and functionally. Genus: It is a group of species which are related and have less characters in common as compared to species. Members of a genus have identical reproductive organs. Family: It is represented by a group of related genera that are more similar to each other than with the genera of other families. Order: It is an assemblage of families resembling one another in a few characters. Class: It represents organisms of related orders. Phylum: It includes all organisms belonging to different classes having a few common characters. kingdom: It includes all organisms who share a set of distinguishing common characters. Thus, by separating organisms on the basis of a hierarchy of characteristics into smaller and smaller groups, we arrive at the basic unit of classification, which is a ‘species’. Broadly, a species include all organisms that are similar enough to breed and perpetuate."
37,Chapter 7 - Diversity in Living Organisms,Animalia,"These are organisms which are eukaryotic, multicellular and heterotrophic. Their cells do not have cell-walls. Most animals are mobile. They are further classified based on the extent and type of the design differentiation found. PORIFERA:- The word Porifera means organisms with holes. These are holes or ‘pores’, all over the body. These lead to a canal system that helps in circulating water throughout the body to bring in food and oxygen. These animals are covered with a hard outside layer or skeleton. The body design involves very minimal differentiation and division into tissues. They are commonly called sponges, and are mainly found in marine habitats. Some examples are Euplectelea, Sycon and Spongilla. COELENTERATA:-These are animals living in water. They show more body design differentiation. There is a cavity in the body. The body is made of two layers of cells: one makes up cells on the outside of the body, and the other makes the inner lining of the body. Some of these species live in colonies (corals), while others have a solitary like-span (Hydra). jellyfish and sea anemones are common examples. PLATYHELMINTHES:- The body of animals in this group is far more complexly designed than in the two other groups we have considered so far. The body is bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that the left and the right halves of the body have the same design. There are three layers of cells from which differentiated tissues can be made, which is why such animals are called triploblastic. This allows outside and inside body linings as well as some organs to be made. There is thus some degree of tissue formation. However, there is no true internal body cavity or coelom, in which well-developed organs can be accommodated. The body is flattened dorsiventrally, meaning from top to bottom, which is why these animals are called flatworms. They are either free- living or parasitic. Some examples are free- living animals like planarians, or parasitic animals like liverflukes for examples. NEMATODA:- The nematode body is also bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic. However, the body is cylindrical rather than flattened. There are tissues, but no real organs, although a sort of body cavity or a pseudocoelom, is present. There are very familiar as parasitic worms causing diseases, such as the worms causing elephantiasis (filarial worms) or the worms in the intestines (roundworm or pinworms). Some examples are Ascaris and Wuchereria. ANNELIDA:- Annelid animals are also bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic, but in addition they have a true body cavity. This allows true organs to be packaged in the body structure. There is, thus, extensive organ differentiation . This differentiation occurs in a segmental fashion, with the segments lined up one after the other from head to tail. These animals are found in a variety of habitats-fresh water marine water as well as land. Earthworms and leeches are familiar examples Nereis, Earthworms and Leech. This is probably the largest group of animals. These animals are bilaterally symmetrical and segmented. There is an open circulatory system, and so the blood does not flow in well-defined blood vessels. The coelomic cavity is blood-filled. They have jointed legs (the word ‘arthropod’ means ‘jointed legs’). Some familiar examples are prawns, butterflies, houseflies, spiders, scorpions and crabs. MOLLUSCA:- In the animals of this group, there is bilateral symmetry. The coelomic cavity is reduced. There is little segmentation. They have an open circulatory system and kidney-like organs for excretion. There is a foot that is used for moving around. Examples are snails and mussels. ECHINODERMATA:- In Greek, echinos means hedgehog, and derma means skin. Thus, these are spiny skinned organisms. These are exclusively free-living marine animals. They are triploblastic and have a coelomic cavity. They also have a peculiar water-driven tube system that they use for moving around. They have hard calcium carbonate structures that they use as a skeleton. Examples are starfish and sea urchins. PROTOCHORDATA:-These animals are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and have a coelom. In addition, they show a new feature of body design, namely a notochord, at least at some stages during their lives. The notochord is a long rod-like support structure (chord=string) that runs along the back of the animal separating the nervous tissue from the gut. It provides a place for muscles to attach for ease of movement. Protochordates may not have a proper notochord present at all stages in their lives or for the entire length of the animal. Protochordates are marine animals. Examples are Balanoglossus, Herdmania and Amphioxus. VERTEBRATA:- These animals have a true vertebral column and internal skeleton, allowing a completely different distribution of muscle attachment points to be used for movements. Vertebrates are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, coelomic and segmented, with complex differentiation of body tissues and organs. All chordates possess the following features:- have a notochord have a dorsal nerve cord are triploblastic have paired gill pouches are coelomate Vertebrates are grouped into five classes:- PISCES:-These are fish. They are exclusively aquatic animals. Their skin is covered with scales/plates. They obtain oxygen dissolved in water by using gills. The body is streamlined, and a muscular tail is used for movement. They are cold-blooded and their hearts have only two chambers, unlike the four that humans have. They lay eggs, we can think of many kinds of fish, some with skeletons made entirely of cartilage, such as sharks and some with a skeleton made of both bone and cartilage, such as tuna or roho. AMPHIBLA:- These animals differ from the fish in the lack of scales, in having mucus galnds in the skin, and a three-chambered heart. Respiration is through either gills or lungs. They lay eggs. These animals are found both in water and on land. Frogs, toads and salamanders are some examples. REPTILIA:- These animals are cold-blooded, have scales and breathe through lungs. While most of them have a three-chambered heart, crocodiles have four heart chambers. They lay eggs with tough coverings and do not need to lay eggs in water, unlike amphibians. Snakes, turtles, lizards and crocodiles fall in this category. AVES:- These are warm-blooded animals and have a four-chambered heart. They lay eggs. There is an outside covering of feathers, and two forelimbs are modified for flight. They breathe through lungs. All birds fall in this category MAMMALIA:- Mammals are worm-blooded animals with four-chambered hearts. They have mammary glands for the production of milk to nourish their young. Their skin has hairs as well as sweat and oil glands. Most mammals familiar to us produce live young ones. However, a few of them, like the platypus and the echidna lay eggs, and some, like kangaroos give birth to very poorly developed young ones. Some examples are cat, human, rat and bat."
38,Chapter 7 - Diversity in Living Organisms,Detailed Classification of Kingdom Plantae,"Kingdom plantae is further divided into various divisions based on various criteria. The first level of classification among plants depends on whether or not the plant body has well-differentiated, distinct components. The next level of classification is based on whether the differentiated plant body has special tissues (vascular tissues-the xylem and phloem) for transport of water and other substances within the plant body. Further classification of plants involves criteria, such as , ability to bear seeds and whether the seeds are enclosed within fruits. THALLOPHYTA:- Plants that do not have well-differentiated body design fall in this group. The plants in this group are commonly called algae. These plants are predominantly aquatic. Examples are Spirogyra, Ulothrix, Cladophora and Chara. BRYOPHYTA:- These are called the amphibians of the plant kingdom. These body is commonly differentiated to form stem and leaf- like structures. However, there is no specialised tissue for the conduction of water and other substances from one part of the plant body to another. Examples are moss (Funaria) and Marchantia. PTERIDOPHYTA:-In this group, the plant body is differentiated into roots, stem and leaves and has specialised tissue for the conduction of water and other substances from one part of the plant body to another. Some examples are Marsilea, Ferns and horse-tails. The thallophytes, the bryophytes and the pteridophytes have naked embryos that are called spores. The reproductive organs of plants in all these three groups are very inconspicuous, and they are therefore called ‘cryptogamae’, or ‘those with hidden reproductive organs’. On the other hand, plants with well-differentiated reproductive tissues that ultimately make seeds are called phanerogams. Seeds are the result of the reproductive process. They consist of the embryo along with stored food, which serves for the initial growth of the embryo during germination. This group is further classified, based on whether the seeds are naked or enclosed in fruits, giving us two groups: gymnosperms and angiosperms. GYMNOSPERMS: This term is made from two Greek words: gymno-means naked and sperms- means seed. This plants of this group bear naked seeds and are usually perennial, evergreen and woody. Examples are pines and deodar. ANGIOSPERMS: This word is made two Greek words: angio means covered and sperma-means seeds. The seeds develop inside an organ which is modified to become a fruit. These are also called flowering plants. Plants embryos in seeds have structures called cotyledons. Cotyledons are called ‘seed leaves’ because in many instances they emerge and become green when the seed germinates. Thus, cotyledons represent a bit of ore-designed plant in the seed. The angiosperms are divided into two groups on the basis of number of cotyledons present on the seed. Plants with seeds having a single cotyledons are called monocotyledons or monocots. Plants with seeds having two cotyledons are called dicots. Fig: Classification of plants"
39,Chapter 7 - Diversity in Living Organisms,Classification and Evolution,"All living things are identified and categorised on the basis of their body design in form and function. Some characteristics are likely to make more wide-ranging changes in body design than others. There is a role of time in this as well. So, once a certain body design comes into existence, it will shape the effects of all other subsequent design changes, simply because it already exists. In other words, characteristics that came into existence earlier are likely to be more basic than characteristics that have come into existence later. Most life forms that we see today have arisen by an accumulation of changes in body design that allow the organism processing them to survive better. Charles Darwin first described this idea of evolution in 1859 in his book, The Origin of Species. When we connect this idea of evolution to classification, we will find some groups of organisms which have ancient body design that have not changed very much. We will also find other groups of organisms that have acquired their particular body designs relatively recently. Those in the first group are frequently refferred to as ‘primitive’ or ‘lower’ organisms, while those in the second group are called ‘advanced’ or ‘higher’ organisms. In other words, it can be said that first formed (ancient, older) organisms are simpler, while younger organisms (later formed, modern) are more complex, i.e., complexity in design of simpler forms has increased over evolutionary time, so that they ultimately become more complex."
40,Chapter 7 - Diversity in Living Organisms,Basis of classification,"Attempts at classifying living things into groups have been made since time immemorial. Greek thinker Aristotle classified animals according to whether they lived on land, in water or in the air. This is a very simple way of looking at life, but misleading too. For example, animals that live in the sea include corals, whales, octopus, starfish and sharks. The diversity shown among present day living organisms is an outcome of the past 3.5 billion years of organic evolution. During this time a great number of new species originated and many more became extinct. Science of Palaeontology studies evidences of the past life, in the form of fossils. with such a huge repository of organisms, it would be almost impossible to study each and every living form separately at an individual level. So, to study the diversity among living organisms is an effective way, we need to arrange various kinds of organisms in an orderly or systematic manner. The method of arranging organisms into groups or sets on the basis of similarities and differences is called classification. Importance of classification The science of classification is known as taxonomy. It is an important branch of biological science. Classification of living organisms has the following advantages:- Classification makes the study of a wide variety of organisms easy. Classification projects before us a picture of all forms at a glance. Classification is essential to understand the interrelationships among different groups of organisms. Classification forms a base for the development of other biological sciences."
41,Chapter 7 - Diversity in Living Organisms,Biodiversity: Diversity of Plants and Animals,"Each organism in this world, whether it is a plant, an animal or a microorganisms ( viruses, bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes ), is unique in itself. This uniqueness of individuals forms the basis of the diversity among the living organisms. The term “biodiversity” is a concise form of “Biological Diversity”. It was coined by Walter G. Rosen in 1986. Biodiversity refers to the diverse or varied forms of living beings which differ from one another in external appearance, size, colour pattern, internal structure, nutrition, behaviour, habitat, etc. Currently there are 1.7 to 1.8 million organisms, all of which are different from one another. They range in size from microorganisms bacteria, hardly a few micrometres in size, to blue whales ( about 30m in length ) and Redwood trees ( Sequoia ) of California ( about 100m in height ). Some pine trees (e.g., Pinus ) live for thousands of years while many insects such as mosquitoes have a life span of a few days. The diversity extends to habitat, habits, nutrition, forms, etc., of different organisms. This bewildering variety of life around us has evolved on the earth over millions of years. However, we do not have more than a tiny fraction of this time to try and understand all these living organisms, so we cannot look at them one by one. instead, we look for similarities among the organisms which will allow us to put them into different classes and then study different classes or groups as a whole."
42,Chapter 8 - Motion,Introduction of Motion,"Rest:- A body is said to be in a state of rest when its position does not change with respect to a reference point. Motion:- A body is said to be in a state of motion when its position change continuously with reference to a point. There are different types motion depending upon the type of path :- Linear motion:- This motion travels along a straight path Oscillatory motion:-This motion travels To and fro path with respect to origin Circular motion:- This motion travels in a circular path Scalar quantity:- It is the physical quantity having its own magnitude but no direction. Ex- Distance, speed. Vector quantity:- It is the physical quantity having its own both magnitude and direction. Ex- Displacement, Velocity."
43,Chapter 8 - Motion,Describing Motion,"To describe the position of an object we need to specify a reference point called the origin. Motion along a straight line The simplest type of motion is the motion along a straight line. Consider the motion of an object moving along a straight path. The objects starts its journey from O which is treated as its reference point. Let A, B and C represent the position of the object at different instants. At first, the objects moves through C and B and reaches A. Then it moves back along the same path and reaches through B. The total path length covered by the object is OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35km = 95km. This is the distance covered by the object. The numerical value of a physical quantity is its magnitude. Displacement:- The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement. It is a vector quantity. Displacement can be negative (-), positive (+) or zero. Displacement can be equal to distance or its lesser than distance. In the above figure if objects starts from O and travel to point A and back to its original position O then its displacement is zero (0) and if objects reaches at C then displacement will be 25km. Two different physical quantities-the distance and the displacement, are used to describe the overall motion of an object and to locate its final position with reference to its initial position. A device that shows the distance travelled by automobiles. Such device is known as an odometer."
44,Chapter 8 - Motion,Uniform motion and Non-uniform motion,"Uniform motion:- As the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion. Example- A car running at a constant speed of say, 10 metres per second, will cover equal distances of 10 metres, every-second, so its motion will be uniform. Non-uniform motion:- As the object covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in non-uniform motion. Example- If we drop a ball from the roof of a tall building, we will find that it covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time. Different objects may take different amounts of time to cover a given distance. Some of them move fast and some move slowly. The rate at which objects move can be different. Also, different objects can move at the same rate. Speed:- The measurement of distance travelled by a body per unit time is called speed. The S.I unit of speed is m/s-1 or m/s. Speed = Distance travelled/ Time Average speed:- The average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. average speed = Total distance travelled/ Total time taken v= s/t Example 1:- An object travels 16m in 4s and then another 16m in 2s. What is the average speed of the object? Total distance travelled by object = 16m + 16m = 32m Total time taken = 4s + 2s = 6s Average speed = Total distance travelled/ total time taken = 32m/6s = 5.33 m s-1 speed with direction:- Velocity:- Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite direction. The velocity of an object can be uniform or variable. It can be changed by changing the object’s speed, direction of motion or both. When an object is moving along a straight line at a variable speed, we can express the magnitude of its rate of motion in terms of average velocity. Average velocity is given by the arithmetic mean of initial velocity and final velocity for a given period of time. Average velocity = initial velocity + final velocity/ 2 Vav= u + v/ 2 Speed and Velocity have the same units, that is , m s-1 or m/s. Example 2:- The odometer of a car reads 2000 km at the start of a trip and 2400 km at the end of the trip. If the trip took 8 h, calculate the average speed of the car in km h-1and m s-1. Distance covered by car (s) = 2400 km – 2000 km = 400 km Time (t) = 8 h Average speed of car (Vav) = s/t = 400km/8h = 50 km h-1 = 50 km/ h  1000 m/1km  1h/ 3600s = 13.9 ms-1 The average speed of the car is 50 km h-1 or 13.9 m s-1."
45,Chapter 8 - Motion,Rate of change of velocity,"Acceleration:- Acceleration of a body is defined as the rate of change of its velocity with time. That is called acceleration. acceleration = Change in velocity/ Time taken for change Now, the change in velocity is the difference between the final velocity and the initial velocity. That is, acceleration = Final velocity – Initial velocity/ Time taken a = v – u/ t where, a = acceleration of the body v = Final velocity of the body u = Initial velocity of the body t = time taken for the change in velocity If the velocity of an object changes from an initial value u to the final value v in time t, this kind of motion is known as accelerated motion. The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity. The S.I unit of acceleration is m s-2. Uniform Acceleration:- A body has a uniform accelerated if it travels in a straight line and its velocity increases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time. Ex- The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformaly accelerated motion. Non-uniform Acceleration:- A body has a non-uniform if its velocity increases by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time. Ex- If a car travelling along a straight road increases its speed by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the car is said to be moving with non- uniform acceleration. Ex- Starting from a stationary position, Rahul paddles his bicycle to attain a velocity of 6 m s-1 in 30 s. Then he applies brakes such that the velocity of the bicycle comes down to 4 m s-1 in next 5 s. Calculate the acceleration of the bicycle in both the cases. Sol:- In the first case: initial velocity (u) = 0 final velocity ( v) = 6 m s-1 time (T) = 30 s a = v – u/ t a = (6m s-1 – 0 m s-1)/30 s = 0.2 m s-2 In second case: initial velocity (u) = 6 m s-1 final velocity (v) = 4 m s-1 time (t) = 5 s a = ( 4 m s-1 – 6 m s-1)/ 5 s = – 0.4 m s-2 The acceleration of the bicycle in the first case is 0.2 m s-2 and in the second case, it is – 0.4 m s-2"
46,Chapter 8 - Motion,Equations of motion by graphical method,"First equation of motion:- The first equation of motion is : v = u + at. It gives the velocity acquired by a body in time t. Acceleration = Change in velocity/ Time taken or, Acceleration = Final velocity – Initial velocity/ Time taken a = v – u/ t at = v – u v = u + at where, v = final velocity of the body u = initial velocity of the body a = acceleration t = time 2. Second equation of motion:- The second equation of motion is s = ut + 1/2at2 . It gives the distance travelled by a body in time t. Average velocity = Initial velocity + Final velocity/ 2 that is, Average velocity = u + v/2 Distance travelled = Average velocity × Time s = ( u + v )/2× t From the above equation of motion we have v = u + at. Putting the value of v in above s = ( u + u + at)/2 X t s = ( 2u + at)/2 × t s = 2ut + at2/ 2 s = ut + 1/2at2 where, s = distance travelled by the body in time t u = Initial velocity of the body a = acceleration 3. Third equation of motion:- The third equation of motion : v2= u2 + 2as. It gives the velocity acquired by a body in travelling a distance s. From the second equation of motion we have: s = ut = 1/2at2…………………(1) And from the first equation of motion we have: v = u + at ………………………..(2) so, at = v -u or t = v – u/a putting the value of t in equation ( 1) we get: s = u(v-u)/a + 1/2× a ( v-u/a )2 s = uv – u2/a + a( v2 + u2 – 2uv)/2a2 (because =(v-u)2 = v2 + u2 – 2as) s = uv – u2/a + v2 + u2 – 2uv/2a s = 2uv – u2 + v2 + u2 – 2uv/ 2a or 2as = v2– u2 v2 = u2 + 2as where, v = final velocity u = initial velocity a = acceleration s = distance travelled"
47,Chapter 8 - Motion,Graphical Representation of Motion,"Graphs provide a convenient method to present basic information about a variety of events. For example, in the telecast of a one-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs show the run rate of a team in each over. To describe the motion of an object, we can use line graphs. In this case, line graphs show dependence of one physical quantity, such as distance or velocity, on another quantity, such as time. Distance-Time Graphs When a body moves with uniform speed, it will travel equal distances with in equal intervals of time. Thus, for uniform speed, a graph of distance travelled against time will be straight line as shown by line OA in fig 1. So, we can write the term ” uniform velocity” in place of “uniform speed” in the graph. So, the distance-time graph of a body moving at uniform speed is always a straight line. The slope of a distance-time graph indicates speed of the body. So, the distance time graph of a body can be used to calculate the speed of the body. Speed = Distance travelled/ time taken Speed = OY/OX If, however, the speed of a body is non-uniform, then the graph between distance travelled and time is a curved line ( called a parabola). When a body moves with a non-uniform speed, then its motion is said to be accelerated. So, the curved line also represents the distance- time graph of a body moving with accelerated motion. Velocity-time graph The variation in velocity with time for an object moving in a straight line can be represented by a velocity-time graph. In this graph, this is represented along the x-axis and the velocity is represented along the y-axis. If the object moves at uniform velocity, the height of its velocity-time graph will not change with time. It will be a straight line parallel to the x-axis. We know that the product of velocity and time give displacement of an object moving with uniform velocity. The area enclosed by velocity-time graph and the time axis will be equal to the magnitude of the displacement. When a body moves with uniform acceleration, its speed changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time. Thus, the speed-time graph for a uniformly changing speed (or uniform acceleration) will be a straight line."
48,Chapter 8 - Motion,Uniform Circular Motion,"When a body (or an object) moves in a circular path with uniform speed, then it is said to be uniform circular motion. In such a motion the speed may be same throughout the motion but its velocity ( which is tangential ) is different at each and every point of its motion. Thus, uniform circular motion is an accelerated motion."
49,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Introduction of Force and Laws of Motion,"Force:- It is the force that enables us to do any work. When we do anything, either we pull or push the object. therefore, pull or push is called force. Example:- When we open a door, either we push or pull it. A drawer is pulled to open and pushed to close."
50,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Effect of Force,"→A ball on the ground , when given a small hit, does not move forever. Such observations suggest that rest is the “natural state”. →In our everyday life we have required to put a stationary object into motion or to stop a moving object. →Force changes the direction of motion. If you kick a ball to the left, you are applying force that changes its original path. →Pushing, hitting and pulling of objects are all ways of bringing objects in motion. They move because we make a force act on them. →Force can be used to change the magnitude of velocity of an object ( that is, to make the object move faster or slower) or to change its direction of motion."
51,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Balanced and Unbalanced Forces,"Balance force:- When equal forces act in opposite directions on an object, they are called balanced forces. In this case there is no any effect on the object’s position and it will remain at rest . Such forces do not cause any changes in motion. Balanced forces can change the shape size of an object. Unbalanced force:- When two opposite forces of different magnitudes acts on object. In this case, the object would begin to move in the direction of the greater force. This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it in motion. Net Force:- The net force is the overall force acting on an object when both the forces acting on it. it determines the direction of in which the object will move and how fast it will accelerate. If the net force is zero, the forces are balanced, and there is no change in motion. However, if the net force is not zero, the forces are unbalanced, and the object’s motion will change accordingly. Frictional force:- Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion of objects in contact with each other. When two surfaces rub against each other, friction acts to resist their motion."
52,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Newton’s laws of motion,"Newton has given three laws to describe the motion of bodies. These laws are known as Newton’s laws of motion. The Newton’s laws of motion give a precise definition of force and establish a relationship between the force applied on a body and the state of motion acquired by it. Newton’s first law of motion:- A body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will continue in motion in a straight line with a uniform speed, unless it is compelled by an external force to change its state of rest or of uniform motion. The tendency of a body to remain at rest (stationary) or, if moving, to continue moving in a straight line, called inertia. Newton’s first law recognizes that every body has some inertia. Inertia is that property of a body due to which it resists a change in its state of rest or of uniform motion. Greater the inertia of a body, greater will be the force required to bring a change in its state of rest or of uniform motion. Mass is a measure of the inertia of a body. If a body has more mass, it has more inertia. That is, heavier objects have more inertia than lighter objects. Example:- a stone has greater inertia than a football. If we kick a stone, it will not move because of its high inertia but if we kick a football, it will move a long way. A stone has more inertia than a football. A cricket ball has more inertia than a rubber ball of the same size. So, the inertia of a body depends on its mass. So we conclude that to overcome the inertia and make a body move from rest, we must apply an external force. It should be noted that Newton’s first law of motion is also some times called Galileo’s law of inertia. Some more examples of law of inertia:- When a tree ( having flexible stem) is shaken vigorously, its fruits and leaves fall down. This is due to the fact that because of their inertia. When a hanging carpet is beaten with a stick, the dust particles start coming out of it. This is because the force of stick makes the carpet move to-and-fro slightly but the dust particles tend to remain at rest due to their inertia and hence separate from the carpet. When a car or bus starts suddenly, the passengers fall backward. This is due to the fact that because of their inertia. When a running car or bus stops suddenly, the passengers are jerked forward because due to inertia. Newton’s first law of motion gives us a definition of force. A force is something which changes or tends to change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body. Force is a vector quantity. Momentum:- The momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity. The force required to to stop a moving body is also directly proportional to its velocity. Thus, the quantity of motion in a body depends on the mass and velocity of the body. Thus, Momentum = mass × velocity P = m × v where, p = momentum m = mass of the body v = velocity of the body If a body is at rest, its velocity is zero and hence its momentum is also zero. Thus, the total momentum of the gun and bullet before firing is zero because their velocity is zero. momentum is a vector quantity. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram metres per second or Kg.ms-1. Every moving body possesses momentum. Since momentum depends on the mass and velocity of a body, so a body will have a large momentum : a) If its mass is larger, or (b) If its velocity is large, or (c) If both its mass and velocity are large. Some examples of momentum:- A karate player can break a pile of tiles or a slab of ice with a single blow of his hand. A cricket ball is not very heavy but when it is thrown with a high speed, it acquires a very momentum and sometimes hurts the batsman. A car or bus may not be running at a high speed but because of its high momentum which may hurt the person coming in its way. Momentum is considered to be a measure of the quantity of motion of a moving body. Ex:- What is the momentum of a man of mass 75kg when he walks with a uniform velocity of 2m/s ? here, mass = 75kg velocity = 2m/s We know that, momentum = mass × velocity p = m × v p = 75 × 2 p = 150 kg.ms-1."
53,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Newton’s second law of motion,"When two bodies, a heavy one and a light one, are acted upon by the same force for the same time, the light body attains a higher velocity than the heavy one. But the momentum gained by both the bodies is the same. The link between force and momentum is expressed in Newton’s second law of motion. According to Newton’s second law of motion:- The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force, and takes in the direction in which the force acts. Force ∝ Change in momentum/ time taken Consider a body of mass m having an initial velocity u. The initial momentum of this body will be mu. Suppose a force F acts on this body for time t and causes the final velocity to become v. The final momentum of this body will be mv. Now, the change in momentum of this body is mv – mu and the time taken for this change is t. So, according to Newton’s second law of motion: F ∝ mv – mu/ t F ∝ m(v – u)/ t But v – u/ t represents change in velocity with time which is known as acceleration ‘a’. So, by writing ‘a’ in place of v – u/ t in the above relation, we get: F ∝ m × a F = k × m × a F = m × a ( k= constant) Force = mass × acceleration Thus, Newton’s second law of motion gives us a relationship between ‘force’ and ‘acceleration’. Newton’s second law of motion also gives us a method of measuring the force in terms of mass and acceleration. F = m × a a = F/m The acceleration produced in a body is directly proportional to the force acting on it and inversely proportional to the mass of the body, The SI unit of force is newton (N). A newton is that force which when acting on a body of mass 1kg produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2 in it. F = m × a 1 newton = 1kg × 1m/s2 Newton’s second law gives us a relationship between the force applied to a body and the acceleration produced in the body. If a minus sign comes with the force, it will indicate that the force is acting in a direction opposite to that in which the body is moving. Application of newton’s second law of motion:- Catching a cricket ball The case of a high jumper The use of seat belts in cars Example:- What force would be needed to produce an acceleration of 4m/s2 in a ball of mass 6 kg? Sol:- Here, Mass = 6 kg Acceleration = 4m/s2 Force = mass × acceleration F = m × a F = 6 × 4 F = 24 N Thus, the force needed is of 24 newtons."
54,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Newton’s third law of motion,"The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction . The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces. Some examples to illustrate Newton’s third law of motion:- When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales. It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A. The force which balance A exerts on balance B is called the action and the force of balance B on balance A is called the reaction. This gives us an alternatives statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Fig :- Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite reaction force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun. Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it backwards. Fig:- A forward force on the bullet and recoil of the gun. Fig:- As the sailor jumps in forward direction, The boat moves backwards."
55,Chapter 9 - Force and Laws of Motion,Conservation of Momentum,"Let two objects ( two balls A and B ) of masses mA and mB are travelling in the same direction along a straight line at different velocities uA and uB, respectively. And there are no other external unbalanced forces acting on them. Let uA>uB and the two balls collide with each other . During collision which lasts for a time t, the ball A exerts a force FAB on ball B and the ball B exerts a force FBA on ball A. Suppose vA and vB are the velocities of the two balls A and B after the collision, respectively. The momenta of ball A before and after the collision are mAuA and mAvA, respectively. The rate of change of its momentum during the collision will be mA (vA – uA)/t. Similarly, the rate of change of momentum of ball B during the collisison will be mB (vB -uB)/t. According to the third law of momentum of ball B during the collision will be mB exerted by ball A on ball B and the force FAB exerted by the ball b on ball A must be equal and opposite to each other. Therefore, FAB = −FBA or, mA ( vA − uA)/t = − mB (vB − uB)/t mAuA + mBuB = mAvA + mBvB Since (mAuA + mBuB) is the total momentum of the two balls A and B before the collision and (mAvA + mBvB) is their total momentum after the collision, we observe that the total momentum of the two balls remains unchanged or conserved provided no other external force acts. As a result of this ideal collision experiment, we say that the sum of momenta of the two objects before collision provided there is no external unbalanced force acting on them. This is known as law of conservation of momentum. Example:- A bullet of mass 20g is horizontally fired with a velocity 150 m s-1 from a pistol of mass 2 kg. What is the recoil velocity of the pistol? Sol:- Mass of bullet = 20 g = 20/1000 = 0.02 kg. Mass of pistol = 2 kg Initial velocities of bullet (u1) and pistol (u2) = 0 Final velocity of bullet (v1) = + 150 m s-1 Let the recoil of velocity of pistol = v Total momenta of the pistol and bullet before fire, when the gun is at rest = (2 + 0.02) × 0 m s-1 = 0 kg m s-1 Total momenta of the pistol and bullet after it is fired = 0.02 kg × ( + 150 m s-1) + 2 kg × v m s-1 = (3 + 2v) kg m s-1 According to law of conservation of momentum, Total momenta after the fire = Total momenta before the fire 3 + 2v = 0 v = – 1.5 m s-1. Negative sign indicates that the direction in which the pistol would recoil is opposite to that of bullet, that is, right to left."
56,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Introduction of gravitation,"A force is needed is needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of an object. We always observe that an object dropped from a height falls towards the earth. We know that all the planets go around the Sun. The moon goes around the earth. In all these cases, there must be some force acting on the objects, the planets and on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp that the same force is called the gravitational force. A stone dropped from a height falls towards the earth because the earth exerts a force of attraction (called gravity) on the stone and pulls it down. The earth attracts (or pulls) all the objects towards its centre. The force with which the earth pulls the objects towards it is called the gravitational force of the earth or gravity (of earth). The gravitational force of the earth (or gravity of earth) is responsible for holding the atmosphere above the earth; for the rain falling to the earth; and for the flow of water in the rivers. It is also the gravitational force of earth (or gravity of earth) which keeps us firmly on the ground. Every Objects in the Universe Attracts Every Other Object According to the Newton, every object in this universe attracts every other object with a certain force. The force with which two objects attract each other is called gravitational force (or gravity). If the masses of the objects (or bodies) are small, then the gravitational force between them is very small (which can not be detected easily). If the object having very large mass, then the gravitational force becomes very large (and its effect can be seen easily). The ‘gravitational force’ or ‘gravity’ is always a force of attraction between two objects (or two bodies)."
57,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Universal law of Gravitation,"The universal law of gravitation was given by Newton. So, it is also known as Newton’s law of gravitation. According to universal law of gravitation:- Every body in the universe attracts every other body with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force is along the line joining the centres of two objects. Let two objects A and B of masses M and m lie at a distance d from each other. Let the force of attraction between two objects be F. According to the universal law of gravitation, the force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses. That is, F ∝ M × m…………………………………………………(1) And the force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, that is, F ∝ 1/d2…………………………………………………………(2) From equation 1 and 2, we get F ∝ M × m/d2 F = G M × m/d2 where G is the constant of proportionality and is called the universal gravitation constant. F × d2 = G M × m G = F d2/M × m The SI unit of G is N m2 kg-2. The value of G was found out by Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) by using a sensitive balance. The accepted value of G is 6.673 × 10-11 N m2 kg-2. Example:- The mass of the earth is 6 × 1024 kg and that of the moon is 7.4 × 1022 kg. If the distance between the earth and the moon is 3.84 × 105 km, calculate the force exerted by the earth on the moon. G = 6.7 × 10-11 N m2 kg-2. Sol:- The mass of the earth (M) = 6 × 1024 kg The mass of the moon (m) = 7.4 × 1022 kg The distance between the earth and the moon (d) = 3.84 × 105km = 3.84 × 105 × 1000 m = 3.84 × 108 m G = 6.7 × 10-11 N m2 kg-2 F = G M × m/d2 F = 6.7 × 10-11 × 6 × 1024 × 7.4 × 1022/ (3.84 × 108)2 F = 2.01 × 1020 N Thus, the force exerted by the earth on the moon is 2.01 × 1020N."
58,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Free fall,"We know that the earth attracts objects towards it. This is due to the gravitational force. Whenever objects fall towards the earth under this force alone, we say that the objects are in free fall. while falling, there is no change in the direction of motion of the objects. But due to the earth’s attraction, there will be a change in the magnitude of the velocity. Any change in velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an objects falls towards the earth, an acceleration is involved. This acceleration is due to to the earth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this acceleration is called the acceleration due to gravitational force of the earth (or acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by g . This unit of g is the same as that of acceleration, that is, m s-2. From second law of motion that force is the product of mass and acceleration. let the mas of the stone is m. Acceleration involved in falling objects due to the gravitational force and is denoted by g. Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational force F will be equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to gravitational force. That is, F = mg We know that, F = G M × m/d2 So, mg = G M × m/d2 g = G M/d2 Where, M = mass of the earth d = distance between the object and the earth The distance d is equal to R, which is the radius of the earth mg = G M × m/R2 g = G M/R2 The earth is not a sphere. As the radius of the earth increases from the poles to the equator, the value of g becomes greater at the poles than at the equator."
59,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,calculate the value of g,"To calculate the value of g, we should put the values of G, M and R, namely, universal gravitational constant G = 6.7 × 10-11 N m2 kg-2, mass of the earth, M = 6 × 1024 kg. and radius of the earth, R = 6.4 × 106 m. g = G M/d2 g = 6.7 × 10-11 N m2 kg-2 × 6 × 1024 kg/ ( 6.4 × 106 m )2 g = 9.8 m s-2 Thus, the value of acceleration due to gravity of the earth, g = 9.8 m s-2."
60,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force of the earth,"We know that an object experiences acceleration during free fall. This acceleration experienced by an object is independent of its mass . This means that all objects hollow or solid, big or small, should fall at same rate. According to a story, Galileo dropped different objects from the top of the Leaning tower of Pisa in Italy to prove the same. As g is constant near the earth, all the equations for the uniformly accelerated motion of objects become valid with acceleration a replaced by g, the equations are:- v = u + at Changes to v = u + gt s = ut + 1/2at2 Changes to h = ut + 1/2gt2 v2 = u2 + 2as Changes to v2 = u2 = 2gh where u and v are the initial and final velocities and s is the distance covered in time, t. In applying these equations, we will take acceleration, a to be positive when it is in the direction of the velocity, that is, in the direction of motion. The acceleration, a will be taken as negative when it opposes the motion. Example:- A car falls off a ledge and drops to the ground in 0.5 s. Let g = 10 m s-2. What is its speed on striking the ground? What is its average speed during the 0.5 s? How high is the ledge from the ground? Sol:- Time (t) = 0.5 s = 1/2 s Initial velocity (u) = 0 m s-1 Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 10 m s-2 Acceleration of the car (a) = + 10 m s-2 (downward) Speed v = u + at v = 10 m s-2 × 0.5 s v = 5 m s-1 2. Average speed = u + v/ 2 = (0 m s-1 + 5 m s-1)/ 2 = 2.5 m s-1 3. Distance = ut + 1/2at2 = 0 × 0.5 + 1/2 × 10 m s-2 × (0.5 s)2 = 1/2 × 10 × 0.25 = 1.25 m"
61,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Mass and Weight,"Mass:- We know that the mass of the object is the measure of its inertia. Greater the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains the same whether the object is on the earth, the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of the object is constant and does not change from place to place. Weight:-The earth attracts every object with a certain force and this force depends on the mass (m) of the object and the acceleration due to gravity (g). The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth. We know that, F = m × a that is, F = m × g The force of attraction of the earth on an object is known as the weight of the object. it is denoted by W. So, W = m × g SI unit of the weight is Newton “N”. The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction. The value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass. That is, W ∝ m. The mass of an object remains the same everywhere, that is, on the earth and on the any planet whereas its weight depends on its location."
62,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Weight of an object on the moon,"The weight of an object on the earth is the force with which the earth attracts the object. In the same way, the weight of an object on the moon is the force with which the moon attracts that object. The mass of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction on objects. Let the mass of an object be m. Let its weight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of the moon be Mm and its radius be Rm. By applying the universal law of the gravitation, the weight of the object on the moon will be Wm = G Mm × m/R2m Let the weight of the same object on the earth We. The mass of the earth is M and its radius is R. Celestial body Mass (kg) Radius (m) Earth 5.98 × 1024 6.37 × 106 moon 7.36 × 1022 1.74 × 106 We = G M × m/R2 Wm = G 7.36 × 1022 kg × m/ (1.74 × 106m)2 Wm = 2.431 × 1010 × G × m…………………………………………..(1) and We = 1.474 × 1011 G × m…………………………………………..(2) Dividing equation 1 by 2 Wm/We = 2.431 × 1010/ 1.474 × 1011 or Wm/We = 0.165 ~~ 1/6 Weight of the object on the moon/Weight of the object on the earth = 1/6 Weight of the object on the moon = (1/6) × its weight on the earth. Example:- Mass of an object is 10 kg. What is its weight on the earth? Solution:- mass (m) = 10 kg Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m s-2 W = m × g W = 10 kg × 9.8 m s-2 = 98 N Thus, the weight of the object is 98 N."
63,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Thrust and Pressure,"Thrust:- The force acting on an object perpendicular to the surface is called thrust. When we stand on loose sand, the force, that is, the weight of our body is acting on an area equal to area of our feet. When we lie down, the same force acts on an area equal to the contact area of of our whole body, which is larger than the area of our feet. Thus, the effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different. In these cases thrust is the same. But effects are different. Therefore the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts. Pressure:-The effect of thrust on sand is larger while standing than while lying. The thrust on unit area is called pressure. Thus, Pressure = thrust/ area Substituting the SI unit of thrust and area so, we get the SI unit of pressure as N/m2 or N m-2. In honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the SI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted as Pa. Ex-A block of wood is kept on a tabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5kg and its dimensions are 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm. Find the pressure exerted by the wooden block on the table top if it is made to lie on the table top with its sides of dimensions (a) 20 cm × 10 cm and (b) 40 cm × 20 cm. Solution :- Mass of wooden block = 5 kg The dimensions = 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm Thrust = F = m × g = 5 kg × 9.8 m s-2 = 49 N Area of a side = length × breadth = 20cm × 10cm 200 cm2 = 0.02 m2 Pressure = 49N/0.02 m2 = 2450 N m-2 When the block lies on its side of dimensions 40 cm × 20 cm, it exerts the same thrust. Area = length × breath = 40 cm × 20 cm = 800 cm2 = 0.08 m2 Pressure = 49N/ 0.08 =612.5 N m-2 The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm × 10 cm is 2450 N m-2 and by the side 40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 n m-2."
64,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Pressure in Fluids,"All liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts pressure on a surface due to its weight. Similarly, fluids have weight, and they also exert pressure on the base and walls of the container in which they are enclosed. Pressure exerted in any confined mass of fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions. Buoyancy The buoyant force is a force that is exerted on an object which is partially or completely immersed in a fluid. The other name for this upward force is called upthrust. Because of the presence of buoyant force, a body that is submerged fully or partly in a fluid will lose its weight. The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid. Why objects float or sink when placed on the surface of water? The nail sinks. The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth on the iron nail pulls it downwards. There is an upthrust of water on the nail, which pushes it upwards. But the downward force acting on the nail is greater than the upthrust of water on the nail. So it sinks. The cork floats while the nails sinks. This happens because of the difference in their densities. The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume. The density of cork is less than the density of water. This means that the upthrust of water on the cork is greater than the weight of the cork. So it floats. Fig:- An iron nail sinks and a cork floats when placed on the surface of water."
65,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Archimedes’ principle,"It states that ” The buoyancy force (or upward force) exerted on a body immersed in a fluid (liquid or gas) is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.” Mathematically: Fb = ρVg Where: Fb = Buoyancy force (N) ρ = Density of fluid (kg/m3) V = Volume of fluid displaced (m3) g = Acceleration due to gravity (m/s2) Applications :- Ship design : Calculating buoyancy and stability Offshore platforms : Ensuring structural integrity. Submarines: Controlling depth buoyancy. Flotation devices: Life jackets, flotation bags. hydroelectric power: Measuring water pressure. lactometers: which are used to determine the purity of a sample of milk."
66,Chapter 10 - Gravitation,Relative Density,"The density of a substance is defined as mass of a unit volume. The unit of density is kilogram per metre cube (kg m-3). It is also known as specific gravity. Relative Density = Density of substance/ Density of water Density of water: At 4°C (39.2°F) = 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) It is different for different substances. Ex- the density of gold is 19300 kg m-3 while that of water is 1000 kg m-3. The density of a given sample of a substance can help us to determine its purity. Since the relative density is a ratio of similar quantities, it has no unit. Example:- Relative density of silver is 10.8. The density of water is 103 kg m-3. What is the density of silver in SI unit? Solution: Relative density of silver = 10.8 Relative density = Density of silver/Density of water Density of silver = Relative density of silver × density of water = 10.8 × 103 kg m-3."
67,Chapter 11 - Work and Energy,Introduction of Work and Energy,"All living beings need food. Living beings have to perform several basic activities to survive. We call such such activities ‘life processes’. The energy for these processes comes from food. We need energy for other activities like playing, singing, reading, writing, thinking, jumping, cycling and running. Activities are strenuous require more energy."
68,Chapter 11 - Work and Energy,Work,"When a force acts on an object and the object shows displacement, the force has done work on the object. Work = Force × Displacement Not much work in spite of working hard Reading, writing, drawing, thinking, analysing are all energy consuming. But in scientific manner, no work is done in this case. A man is completely exhausted in trying to push a rock or wall but work done is zero as wall is stationary. A man standing still with heavy suitcase may be tried soon but he does no work in this situation as he is stationary. Work is said to be done when:- a moving object comes to rest. an object at rest starts moving. velocity of an object changes. shape of an object changes. Scientific conception of work:- Work is done when a force is applied on a body and when that forces produces motion under its influence. Condition of work:- Force should be applied on the body Body should be displaced. Work is not done when:- If any one of the above conditions does not exist, work is not done. Work done by a fixed force:- y Work done in moving a body is equal to the product of force and displacement of body in the direction of force. Work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. Work has only magnitude and no direction. Work = Force × Displcement W = F × S Work is a scalar quantity. SI unit of work is Newton metre or Joule. When a force of 1 Newton moves a body through a distance of 1metre in its own direction, then the work done is known as 1 Joule. 1 Joule = 1 Newton × 1 metre 1 J = 1 Nm Factors of work done:- Work done by a force can be positive, negative or zero. Positive work:-Work done is positive when a force acts in the direction of motion of the body. (θ = 0°) Negative work:-Work done is negative when a force acts opposite to the direction of the body. (θ = 180°) Zero work:-Work done is zero when a force acts at right angles to the direction of motion. (θ =90°)"
69,Chapter 11 - Work and Energy,Energy,"The capacity of doing work is known as energy. The sun is the biggest source of energy. most of the energy sources are derived from the d=sun. Some energy is received from nucleus of atoms, interior of the earth and the tides. The energy possessed by an object is thus measured in terms of its capacity of doing work. SI unit of energy is same as the work of unit that is Joule (J). Its bigger unit is kilo joule (kJ). 1 kJ = 1000 J. There are different forms of energy:-0 Kinetic energy Potential energy Heat energy Chemical energy Electrical energy Light energy Sound energy Nuclear energy Kinetic Energy Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed. Examples of Kinetic energy:- A moving cricket ball Running water A moving bullet Flowing wind A moving car A running athelete A rolling stone If an object of mass ‘m’ moving with uniform velocity ‘u’ , it is displaced through a distance ‘s’. Constant force ‘f’ acts on it in the direction of displacement. Its velocity changes from ‘u’ to ‘v’. W = F × S………………………………………….(1) F = m × a…………………………………………..(2) According to the third equation of motion v2 – u2 = 2as s = ( v2 – u2 )/2a……………………………….(3) W = m a × (v2 – u2/2a) W = 1/2 m ( v2 – u2) If the object is starting from its stationary position, that is u = 0, then W = 1/2 m ( v2 – 02) W = 1/2 mv2 Thus, the kinetic energy possessed by an object of mass, m and moving with a uniform velocity, v is Ek = 1/2m v2 Example:- An object of mass 15 kg is moving with a uniform velocity of 4 m s-1 . What is the kinetic energy possessed by the object? Solution:- Mass of the object (m) = 15 kg Velocity of the object (v) = 4 m s-1 Ek = 1/ 2 m v2 = 1/2 × 15 kg × 4 m s-1× 4 m s-1 = 120 J The kinetic energy of the object is 120 J. Potential energy The potential energy possessed by the object is the energy present in it by virtue of its position or configuration. Examples:- Water kept in dam : It can rotate turbine to generate electricity due to its position above the ground. Bent string of bow : Potential energy due to change of its shape released in the form of kinetic energy while shooting an arrow. Potential energy of an object at a height:- An object increases its energy when raised through a height. This is because work is done on it against gravity while it is being raised. The energy present in such an object is the gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential energy of an object at a point above the ground is defined as the work done in raising it from the ground to that point against gravity. Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be raised through a height, h from the ground. A force is required to do this. The minimum force required to raise the object is equal to the weight of the object, mg. The object gains energy equal to the work done on it. Let the work done on the object against gravity be W. That is, work done , W = force × displacement = mg × h = mgh Thus, the potential energy of the object is Ep = mgh Example:- Find the energy possessed by an object of mass 10kg when it is at a height of 6 m above the ground. Given g = 9.8 m s-2. Sol:- Mass of the object (m) = 10 kg displacement (h) = 6 m acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m s-2 Potential energy = mgh = 10 kg × 9.8 m s-2 × 6 m = 588 J The potential energy is 588 J."
70,Chapter 11 - Work and Energy,Rate of Doing work,"Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy. Power (P) = Work done / Time taken P = W/t Where, P = Power W = Work done t = Time taken SI unit of power is Watt (W) 1 Watt (W) = 1 Joule/1 second = 1J/1s Power is one Watt when one joule work is done in one second. Average power = Total work done or total energy used/ Total time taken 1 Kilowatt = 1000 watts 1 kW = 1000 W 1 kW = 1000 J s-1 The power of an agent may vary with time. This means that the agent may be doing work at different rates at different intervals of time. Therefore the concept of average power is useful. We obtain average power by dividing the total energy consumed by the total time taken. Ex:- A boy of mass 50 kg runs up a staircase of 45 steps in 9 s. If the height of each step is 15 cm. Find his power. (g=10 m s-2) Sol:-Weight of boy (mg) = 50 kg × 10 m s-2 = 500 N height of staircase (h) = 45 × 15/100 m = 6.75 m Total time taken (t) = 9 s Power (p) = Work done / time taken = mgh/t = 500 N × 6.75 m/9s = 375 W Thus, the power is 375 W."
71,Chapter 11 - Work and Energy,Commercial unit of energy,"The unit joule is too small and hence is inconvenient to express large quantities of energy. We use a bigger unit of energy called kilowatt hour (kWh). Thus, 1 kilowatt hour = 1 Kilowatt for 1 hour at the rate of 1000 J s-1 (or 1 kW). 1 kWh = 1 kW × 1 h = 1000 W × 3600 s = 3600000 J 1 kWh = 3.6 × 106 J. The energy used in households, industries and commercial establishments are usually expressed in kilowatt hour. Example :- electrical energy used during a month is expressed in terms of ‘units’. 1 unit means 1 kilowatt hour."
72,Chapter 11 - Work and Energy,Law of conservation of energy,"Whenever energy changes from one form to another form, the total amount of energy remains constant. According to this law, energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid in all situations and for all kinds of transformation. Conservation of energy during free fall of a body A ball of mass ‘m’ at a height ‘h’ has potential energy = mgh. As ball falls downwards, height ‘h’ decreases, so the potential energy also decreases. Kinetic energy at ‘h’ is zero but it is increasing during falling of ball. The sum of potential energy & kinetic energy of the ball remains the same at every point during its fall. Kinetic energy + potential energy = Constant 1/2mv2 + mgh = constant The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy. During free fall of the object, the decreases in potential energy, at any point in its path, appears as an equal amount of increase in kinetic energy. There is thus a continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy."
73,Chapter 12 - Sound,Introduction of Sound,"Everyday we hear sounds from various sources like humans, birds, bells, machines, vehicles, televisions, radios etc. Sound is a form of energy which produces a sensation of hearing in our ears. There are also other forms of energy like mechanical energy, heat energy, light energy etc. We will learn how sound is produced and how it is transmitted through a medium and received by our ear."
74,Chapter 12 - Sound,Production of Sound,"We can produce sound by striking the tuning fork. We can also produce sound by plucking, scratching, rubbing, blowing or shaking different objects. We set the objects vibrating and produce sound. Vibration means a kind of rapid to and fro motion of an object. The sound of human voice cords. A stretched rubber band when plucked vibrates and produces sound."
75,Chapter 12 - Sound,Propagation of Sound,"Sound is produced by vibrating objects. The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium. It can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a medium from the point of generation to the listener. When an object vibrates, it sets the particles of the medium around it vibrating. The particles do not travel all the way from the vibrating object to the ear. A particle of the medium in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position. It then exerts a force on the adjacent particle. As a result of which the adjacent particle gets displaced from its position of rest. After displacing the adjacent particle the first particle comes back to its original position. This process continues in the medium till the sound reaches your ear. The disturbance created by a source of sound in the medium travels through the medium and not the particles of the medium."
76,Chapter 12 - Sound,Sound Needs A Medium To Travel,"Sound is a mechanical wave and needs a material medium like air, water, steel etc. For its propagation. It cannot travel through vacuum. An electric bell is suspended in airtight glass bell jar . The electric bell is suspended inside the airtight bell jar. The bell jar is connected to a vacuum pump. When bell jar is full of air, we hear the sound but when air is pumped out from the bell jar by vacuum pump and we ring the bell, no sound is heard. So, medium is necessary for propagation of sound."
77,Chapter 12 - Sound,Sound Waves Are Longitudinal Waves,"The regions where the coils become closer are called compressions (C) and the regions where the coils are further apart are called rarefactions (R). Sound propagates in the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions. Now, we can compare the propagation of disturbance in a slinky with the sound propagation in the medium. These waves are called longitudinal waves. In these waves the individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. The particles do not move from one place to another but they simply oscillate back and forth about their position of rest. Hence sound waves are longitudinal waves. There is also another type of wave called transverse wave. In a transverse wave particles do not oscillate along the line of wave propagation but oscillate up and down about their mean position as the wave travels. Thus a transverse wave is the one in which the individual particles of the medium move about their mean positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation."
78,Chapter 12 - Sound,Characteristics Of Sound Wave,"We can describe a sound wave by its frequency amplitude and speed A sound wave in graphic form which represents how density and pressure change when the sound wave moves in the medium. The density as well as the pressure of the medium at a given time varies with distance, above and below the average value of density and pressure. Image (a) Shows the density and image (b) shows the pressure variations as a sound wave propagates in the medium. Compressions are the regions where particles are crowded together and represented by the upper portion of the curve in image (c). The peak represents the region of maximum compression. Thus, compressions are regions where density as well as pressure is high. rarefactions are the regions of low pressure where particles are spread apart and are represented by the valley, that is, the lower portion of the curve in image (c). A peak is called the crest and a valley is called the trough of a wave. The distance between two consecutive compressions (C) or two consecutive rarefactions (R) is called the wavelength. The wavelength is usually represented by λ. Its SI unit is metre (m). We know that when sound propagated through a medium, the density of the medium oscillates between a maximum value and a minimum value. The change in density from the maximum value to the minimum value, makes one complete oscillations per unit time is the frequency of the sound wave. If we count the number of compressions or rarefactions that cross us per unit time, we will get the frequency of the sound wave. It is usually represented by v (Greek letter, nu ). Its SI unit is hertz (symbol, Hz). The time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point is called the time period of the wave. It is represented by the symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s). Frequency and time period are related as follows : v = 1/T Objects of different sizes and conditions vibrate at different frequencies to produce sounds of different pitch. Fig:- Low pitch sound has low frequency and high pitch of sound has high frequency. The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value is called the amplitude of the wave. It is usually represented by the letter A. For sound its unit will be that of density or pressure. The loudness or softness of a sound is determined basically by its amplitude. The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate. A sound wave spreads out from out from its source. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases . The wave shapes of a loud and a soft sound of the same frequency. The quality or timber of sound is that characteristic which enables us to distinguish one sound from another having the same pitch and loudness. The sound which is more pleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound of single frequency is called a tone. The sound which is produced due to a mixture of several frequencies is called a note and is pleasant to listen to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music is pleasant to hear and is of rich quality."
79,Chapter 13 - Why Do We Fall ill,Disease and Its Causes,"What does disease look like? :- There are many tissues in the body. These tissues make up physiological systems or organ systems that carry out body functions. Each of the organ systems has specific organs as its parts, and it has particular functions. So, the digestive system has the stomach and intestines, and it helps to digest food taken in from outside the body. The musculoskeletal system, which is made up of bones and muscles, holds the body parts together and helps the body move. When there is a disease, either the functioning or the appearance of one or more systems of the body will change for the worse. These changes give rise to symptoms of disease are the things we feel as being ‘wrong’. So we have a headache, we have cough, we have loose motions, we have a wound with pus; these are all symptoms. These indicate that there may be a disease, but they don’t indicate what the disease is. Ex- a headache may mean just examination stress or, very rarely, it may mean meningitis, or any one of a dozen different diseases."
80,Chapter 13 - Why Do We Fall ill,Differences between Being Healthy and Disease-free,"Being Healthy Being Disease-free It is a state of being well enough to function well physically, mentally and socially. It is a state of absence from disease. It refers to the individual, physical and social environment. It refers only to the individual. The individual has good health. The individual may have good health or poor health."
81,Chapter 13 - Why Do We Fall ill,Health and its Failure,"The significance of Health:- Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being. The conditions necessary for good health are:- Good physical and social environment:- It includes clean surroundings, good sanitation, proper garbage disposal and clean drinking water. Good economic conditions:- It includes job opportunities for earning to have nutritious food and to lead a healthy life. Community Health:- All those activities which people do both individually and in groups for the development of their society, constitute the community health. Personal and community health are supplementary to each other. We protect ourselves by keeping our body clean and for this we also require a good and healthy environment in our surroundings. So, both personal and community health are inter-related."
82,Chapter 13 - Why Do We Fall ill,Introduction,"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Basic conditions for good health: Proper balanced and nutritious diet. Personal hygiene. Clean environment and surroundings. Healthy air, no pollution in the surrounding. Regular exercise. Proper rest. Good standard of living and economy status. We know that cells are the basic units of living beings. Cells are made of a variety of chemical substances- proteins , carbohydrates , fats or lipids and so on. Cells move from place to place. Even in cells that do not move, there is repair going on. New cells are being made. In our organs or tissues, there are various specialised activities going on- the heart is beating, the lungs are breathing, the kidney is filtering urine, the brain is thinking. All these activities are interconnected. For all these interconnected activities, energy and raw material are needed from outside the body."
